    <h1 style="color:midnightblue;font-size:40px;font-weight: bolder;">Our Causes</h1>
<h2 style="color:midnightblue;font-size:34px;font-weight: bolder;">Help For Education</h2>
    <p style="color:black;font-size:23px;font-weight: normal;">Education should never work against a person's destiny, but should achieve the full development of his or her own dispositions.  The education of people today so often lags behind the talents and tendencies which their destinies have implanted in them.  We must keep pace with these powers to such an extent that the human beings in our care can win their way through to all that their destinies will allow--to the fullest clarity of thought, the most loving deepening of their feeling, and the greatest possible energy and ability of will. This can only be done by an art of education and teaching which is based on a real knowledge of people.Our target is to ensure education for all children and also for workers who are iliterate</p>
    
    <h2 style="color:midnightblue;font-size:34px;font-weight: bolder;">Food Help For The Hunger People</h2>
    <p style="color:black;font-size:23px;font-weight: normal;">Everything from collecting food to distributing among hungry people is tackled by volunteers. “Definitely it helps us organise the volunteers, and manage everything from beforehand if the contributor informs us a few days before the event,” Ikramuddin added. A total of 300 volunteers, which was 200 at the beginning, 150 volunteers in Dhaka and another 150 in other cities, are passionately working day and night to eradicate hunger. Mostly students from different public and private universities, the volunteers are assigned with areas based on their access and proximity.</p>
    
    <h2 style="color:midnightblue;font-size:34px;font-weight: bolder;">Provide Clothes For Needy People In Winter</h2>
    <p style="color:black;font-size:23px;font-weight: normal;">For a massive proportion of the population, winter means enduring a series of hardships and miseries. While we go on with living our lives in the comfort of our snug homes, there are many who cannot afford even a day's meal adequately, let alone buy proper winter wear. So instead of stacking up those extra blankets and clothes that do not fit you anymore, give them away to a needy family. Your donation, no matter how big or small, can bring a smile to the face of someone who is in dire need of it somewhere and make their life a little less difficult to live.</p>
